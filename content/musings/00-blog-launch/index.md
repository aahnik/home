## Why a personal blog

I had in past written in [dev.to](https://dev.to/aahnik) and medium, and a lot in my personal Obsidian, and in random WhatsApp groups, Discord chats and so on.

Its time to have a digital space for all my rants, and ramblings and musings.

A space where I can get breathe serendipity,and get inspired to do awesome stuff.


## End to Procastrination

Special thanks to my god, and my hero, Arpit Bhayani, who really motivated me to start writing again.

I have been procastrinating a lot about launching my own blog/digital garden. Calling it a blog might not be great, because its my own digital space. I will post anything I like, from my personal notes, to observations and realizations, and everything.

Finally I decided to go with Hugo, and this theme called typo. I have customized this theme a bit, my adding my own theme switch copied from Hugo PaperMod theme.

## The Future

Over time, I will make some changes to improve the functionality of this site, but I will always keep it very minimalistic and clean.

One thing, i can guarantee, is that I will never post LLM generated shit. Evey word that goes here, are true reflection of neurons firing in my own organic brain.

I dont believe in polishing english too much, that looses the natural essence, I have.
I might use grammarly to fix a few typos, and grammar here and there,but, I commit to not using LLMs.
